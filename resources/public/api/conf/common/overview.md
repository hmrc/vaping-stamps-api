## Overview
Use the Vaping Stamps API to control who can buy vaping duty stamps and to receive stamp usage data for compliance.
The API is used by a single commercial stamp supplier appointed by HMRC. It is not publicly available and is not used directly by vaping businesses.
The service provides:
- one API endpoint for approval check and approval status updates
- a secure bulk file upload process for weekly data submission
  When approvals are revoked or stamp limits change, those updates appear in relevant API responses within the agreed SLA.

## Request access to the API
This is a restricted-access API. The endpoint is available only to authorised and approved software applications.
Because this API is restricted, you must request access before your software application can be subscribed.
## Who can request access
To request access, you must:
- be the commercial stamp supplier appointed by HMRC
- have an HMRC Developer Hub account with a registered software application
  HMRC may ask you to provide evidence of your organisation’s role or relationship to confirm eligibility.
  If you do not have a Developer Hub account, [you can register for one on GOV.UK](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration).
  Your account must use a work email address.
## How to request access
Once your Developer Hub account and software application are set up:
1. [Sign in to HMRC Developer Hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/login)
2. Return to this API landing page.
3. Go to the Endpoint section and select Request access.
4. Complete the request form with:
    - your organisation name
    - the API name: Vaping Stamps API
    - the application ID for your Developer Hub software application 

HMRC may contact you to discuss your request and confirm eligibility. 

If your request is approved, you will receive a confirmation email and your software application will be subscribed to the API.

If you are not signed in, or access has not yet been granted, the Endpoint section will not display a subscription link. You may see 'Not applicable' or 'Request access' instead.
