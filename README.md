## Project Title

Vaping Stamps API Microservices

## Project Description

The UK Government announced the introduction of a new excise duty on vaping products to be introduced from 1st October 2026. 

Vaping Stamps APIs will complement HMRC's traditional tax compliance efforts to ensure that only approved businesses sell vaping products and that the necessary duty is paid. It will also help tackle the illicit trade that occurs in this business sector and so damages legitimate businesses. 

The APIs will provide a facility for the third party client stamp producer to only sell stamps to traders that are approved by HMRC. It will also enable the third party client to forward the necessary information to HMRC which is required to track compliance.
